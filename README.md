# Algorithm Visualizer

This is the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer project, which was made using React. The website was designed with the goal of providing the user better understanding of how different sorting algorithms function by displaying a graphic representation that can be adjusted to match the user's specific needs. Implementing the heap sort sorting mechanism was the most challenging component of this project. It was the most complex to present the animations for since it featured the most elements.
